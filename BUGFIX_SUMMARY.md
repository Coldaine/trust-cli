# Critical Bug Fix Summary

## Hash Mismatch Issue Resolution

**Date:** July 11, 2025  
**Issue:** [#9](https://github.com/audit-brands/trust-cli/issues/9)  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and Verified  
**Commit:** 3a7cd977

### Problem

All model downloads were failing verification with "Hash mismatch" errors even after successful downloads, causing 2GB+ model files to be deleted after completion.

### Root Cause

Inconsistency in pending hash value representations between ModelManager (`'sha256:pending'`) and ModelIntegrityChecker (`'pending_verification'`).

### Solution

Updated verification logic in `modelIntegrity.ts` to handle both pending hash formats:

```typescript
// Enhanced verification logic
const isPending =
  expectedHash === 'pending_verification' || expectedHash === 'sha256:pending';
if (expectedHash && !isPending) {
  const hashMatch = computedHash === expectedHash.replace('sha256:', '');
  // ... hash comparison logic
}
```

### Impact

- ✅ Model downloads now complete successfully
- ✅ Hash verification works for both pending formats
- ✅ No more premature "Hash mismatch" failures
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

### Testing

- Successfully downloaded `phi-3.5-mini-uncensored` (2.2GB) without errors
- Verification process works properly for both new and existing models
- End-to-end model download and verification flow confirmed

### Files Modified

- `packages/core/src/trust/modelIntegrity.ts` - Fixed verification logic

This was a critical infrastructure bug that blocked all model installations and has been successfully resolved.
