# Tool Summarization Feature Implementation

**Date**: 2025-01-12  
**Task**: Task 38 (P3) - Upstream commit 23197151  
**Author**: Claude (AI Assistant)

## Overview

This document explains the tool summarization feature being added from the upstream gemini-cli repository. This feature allows tools to provide AI-generated summaries of their outputs, making results more concise and digestible.

## What This Feature Does

The tool summarization feature adds an **optional** `summarizer` method to tools that can:

- Take the raw tool output after execution
- Use AI to generate a concise summary of what happened
- Return this summary for display to users

**Important**: This is an **additive, optional feature** that should not affect existing tool behavior.

## Why This Won't Break Existing Tools

1. **Optional Method**: The `summarizer` method is optional. Tools without it continue to work exactly as before.
2. **Post-Execution**: Summarization happens AFTER tool execution completes successfully.
3. **Fallback Behavior**: If no summarizer is provided or summarization fails, the original output is used.
4. **No Impact on Core Logic**: The tool's `execute()` method and core functionality remain unchanged.

## Implementation Details

### Changes to Tool Interface

```typescript
// Added to Tool interface
summarizer?: (
  result: ToolResult,
  client: GeminiClient,
  signal: AbortSignal
) => Promise<string>;
```

**IMPORTANT UPDATE**: The implementation uses `GeminiClient` which is cloud-specific. This needs to be refactored to use our backend-agnostic content generator to respect the local-first architecture (Ollama/HuggingFace preference).

### Changes to Tool Schedulers

- `coreToolScheduler.ts`: After successful execution, checks for summarizer and calls it
- `nonInteractiveToolExecutor.ts`: Same logic for non-interactive mode
- Result includes optional `summary` field alongside original output

### Example Use Case

A shell command that outputs 200 lines of logs could have a summarizer that returns:
"Successfully compiled 45 files. No errors found. Build completed in 12.3 seconds."

## Monitoring for Regressions

Watch for:

1. Tools still executing normally without summarizers
2. Original output still available even when summaries are generated
3. No performance degradation from optional summarization
4. Error handling continues to work as expected

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. Remove the `summarizer` property from Tool interface
2. Remove summarization logic from schedulers
3. All tools will continue working with their original output

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Long outputs get concise summaries
2. **Backward Compatible**: No changes to existing tools required
3. **Opt-in**: Only tools that benefit from summarization need to implement it
4. **Future-Ready**: Enables smarter tool output handling

## Testing Strategy

1. Verify existing tools work without changes
2. Add summarizer to one simple tool (e.g., shell) as proof of concept
3. Ensure fallback behavior works when summarizer fails
4. Check performance impact is minimal
