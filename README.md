## üõ°Ô∏è Key Features

- **100% Local Execution** - All AI inference runs on your hardware
- **Privacy First** - Your data never leaves your machine
- **Model Management** - Download, verify, and manage GGUF models locally
- **Performance Monitoring** - Real-time system metrics and optimization
- **Hardware-Aware** - Automatic optimization based on your system specs
- **Transparent** - Open source with cryptographic model verification

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/audit-brands/trust-cli.git
cd trust-cli

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Bundle for production use
npm run bundle

# Run Trust CLI
node bundle/trust.js
```

### First Steps

**IMPORTANT**: All trust commands are run from your **regular terminal** (not from within the trust CLI interface).

Navigate to your trust-cli directory and run commands using the following format:

1. **Check available models**
   ```bash
   # From your regular terminal in the trust-cli directory:
   node bundle/trust.js model list
   ```

2. **Download a model** (start with the lightweight one)
   ```bash
   node bundle/trust.js model download qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct
   ```

3. **Verify model integrity**
   ```bash
   node bundle/trust.js model verify qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct
   ```

4. **Switch to the downloaded model**
   ```bash
   node bundle/trust.js model switch qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct
   ```

5. **Start interactive mode** (optional)
   ```bash
   node bundle/trust.js
   ```

### üí° Create an Alias for Easier Use

To avoid typing `node bundle/trust.js` every time, create an alias:

```bash
# Option 1: Using full path (recommended for permanent setup)
# Add this to your ~/.zshrc (macOS) or ~/.bashrc (Linux):
alias trust="node /full/path/to/your/trust-cli/bundle/trust.js"

# Option 2: Using current directory (works from trust-cli folder)
# Add this to your ~/.zshrc file:
alias trust="node $(pwd)/bundle/trust.js"

# Reload your shell configuration:
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc

# Now you can run commands simply as:
trust model list
trust model download qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct
trust model recommend coding
```

```

**Model Selection Guide:**
- **Standard models** (`phi-3.5-mini-instruct`, `llama-*`, `qwen-*`): Best for general development, have safety guardrails
- **Uncensored model** (`phi-3.5-mini-uncensored`): For auditors & security researchers who need to explore edge cases without content filtering
- **Reasoning model** (`deepseek-r1-distill-7b`): Excels at complex analysis, step-by-step reasoning, and problem-solving - ideal for auditors working through complex risk scenarios

All models use community GGUF conversions that are publicly accessible.

#### HF Authentication (Future Use)

Trust-cli supports Hugging Face authentication for future gated models:

```bash
# Set up authentication (for gated models in the future)
trust auth login --hf-token YOUR_TOKEN

# Check authentication status
trust auth status

# Remove authentication
trust auth logout
```

Currently, all included models are publicly accessible without authentication.

## üîß Configuration

Trust CLI stores its configuration and models in `~/.trustcli/`:
- `models/` - Downloaded model files
- `models.json` - Model configurations and metadata
- `config.json` - CLI settings

### Environment Variables

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "OAuth/Google authentication required" Error

If you're getting OAuth authentication errors when expecting local model inference, you may have legacy settings from an earlier version. Fix this by updating your authentication mode:

```bash
# Quick fix - update settings to use local models
echo '{
  "selectedAuthType": "trust-local",
  "theme": "GitHub"
}' > ~/.gemini/settings.json
```

**Alternative manual fix:**
```bash
# Edit your settings file
nano ~/.gemini/settings.json

# Change "oauth-personal" to "trust-local"
# Change: "selectedAuthType": "oauth-personal"
# To: "selectedAuthType": "trust-local"
```

After updating, restart trust-cli and it should use local models instead of trying to authenticate with Google.

### "No model loaded" Error

This usually means you need to download a model first:

```bash
# Download the lightweight model
node bundle/trust.js model download qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct

# Switch to the downloaded model
node bundle/trust.js model switch qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct

# Verify the model is loaded
node bundle/trust.js model list
```

### Models Not Showing After Git Pull/Rebuild

If you're only seeing 4 models instead of 6 after pulling updates, this is usually a caching issue:

**Step 1: Clear Trust CLI Cache**
```bash
# Clear all trust-cli cached data
rm -rf ~/.trustcli

# Also clear legacy cache if it exists
rm -rf ~/.gemini
```

**Step 2: Force Clean Rebuild (if cache clearing doesn't work)**
```bash
# Force clean everything
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf packages/*/node_modules
rm -rf packages/*/dist
rm -rf bundle
rm -f package-lock.json
rm -f packages/*/package-lock.json

# Fresh install and build
npm install
npm run build
npm run bundle
```

**Step 3: Update Your Alias**
```bash
# Test with direct path first
node bundle/trust.js model list

# Update your alias to current directory
alias trust="node $(pwd)/bundle/trust.js"

# Make permanent by adding to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
echo 'alias trust="node /full/path/to/your/trust-cli/bundle/trust.js"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Step 4: Verify All 6 Models Appear**
You should see:
- qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct (1.5B, 2GB)
- llama-3.2-3b-instruct (3B, 4GB)  
- phi-3.5-mini-instruct (3.8B, 3GB)
- phi-3.5-mini-uncensored (3.8B, 3GB)
- deepseek-r1-distill-7b (7.6B, 6GB)
- llama-3.1-8b-instruct (8B, 8GB)

### TypeScript Build Errors on Node.js v24+

If you encounter TypeScript build errors on newer Node.js versions:

```bash
# Pull the latest fixes
git pull origin main

# Rebuild
npm run build
npm run bundle
```
